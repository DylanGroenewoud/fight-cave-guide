# No Prayer Fight Cave Guide

A RuneLite plugin designed for players attempting the fight caves without prayer.  
This plugin provides information on where to run and when to request a logout. 
This allows players to focus on the run rather than having to constantly tab out to check the Wiki rotation page.

## Requirements

- Works only with **Rotation 2** of the Fight Caves.
